    "Go back and review your slides/notes on SVD. Also, feel free to ask around. In short, an SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) of a matrix is a low-rank approximation of that matrix. What does this mean? Suppose the original matrix was of rank $R$, and we are trying to reduce it to rank $K$. SVD is the result of taking this list of $R$ unique vectors and approximating them as a linear combination of $K$ unique vectors."

    "Another way to think about this is geometrically - in SVD: $$ A \\approx U \\Sigma V^{T} $$ Suppose we multiply a vector $z$ with $A$. $$ A v \\approx U \\Sigma V^{T} z$$ We can think of this as a 3-step process: first, $V^{T}$ hits $z$ and *rotates* it into its eigenbasis (don't worry if you don't know what that is - all you should get out is that this first step is a rotation. Remember, $U$ and $V$ are orthonormal, so they don't change the magnitude of $z$, they only rotate). Then in step 2, $\\Sigma$ hits $z$ and stretches it along the principal axes - remember, $\\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix, so what's happening here is that each element of the newly rotated $z$ is being scaled by a certain amount, the singular values. Finally in step 3, $U$ hits $z$ and rotates back into $z$'s *original* basis. Here's a visual of this whole process:"

    "You may notice something curious - train accuracy is lower than test accuracy?! What is happening here is a severe case of underfitting - the model is not complex enough (indeed, for an image recognition task, a linear model is very simple). Thus, the scores will be very similar - however here the fact that test set performance is higher than training set performance is just an anomaly, due to variance. Proper cross validation would solve this issue."

    "What did we notice? Well the train accuracy certainly decreased, but the test accuracy increased! (not by much - a different dataset would have proved this point better, but for ease of use we stick with a linear MNIST example). So let's recap: before we had 28x28=784 components, and after reducing our data to 100 components our test accuracy increased by train accuracy decreased. This is a very important lesson in bias-variance. In the section below, explain very clearly how this demonstrates the bias-variance tradeoff, and what influences increased bias and what influences increased variance."
